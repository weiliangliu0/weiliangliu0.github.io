<!-- <h2>About Me</h2>-->

<p class="adjust-line-length"> 
Hi! I am a principal researcher at the <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/" target="_blank" > University of Chicago Booth School of Business</a>, working with Professor <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/w/amy-ward" target="_blank" > Amy  Ward</a>.  
Previsouly, I obtained my Ph.D. at the National University of Singapore in 2025, and B.E. from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020.

I was fortunate to visit Professor <a href="https://chan.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Timothy Chan</a> at the University of Toronto in 2023 Fall, and Professor <a href="https://people.miami.edu/profile/1d92943aaf793b047e6a5017b9f4a5c1" target="_blank">Xu Sun</a> at the University of Florida in 2019 Summer.
Previously, I obtained my B.E. from the <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> in 2020.
</p>-->

<p>  I will be joining the Department of SEEM at the <a href="https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Chinese University of Hong Kong</a> as an Assistant Professor in November 2025.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p> 
My research leverages stochastic modeling and control, queueing theory, optimization, and data analytics to tackle complex operational challenges in the following areas:
<ul>
<li><b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font color="#750F09">Modern service operations</font></span></b>: Improve service environments featured by innovative business models, technologies and initiatives, e.g., on-demand workforces, drones, and large language models.</li>
<li><b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font color="#750F09">Socially responsible operations</font></span></b>: Enhance service systems to meet societal needs and create public impact, e.g., cardiac arrest response, community first responder programs, and lift-trap rescue.
</li>
<li><b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font color="#750F09">Data-driven queueing control</font></span></b>: Develop data-driven and provably "optimal" policies for queuing systems with unknown system primitives.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
My <a href="https://weiliangliu0.github.io/publication/" target="_blank">research works</a> have been published in top outlets, including Operations Research, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, and Production & Operations Management, and have received notable recognitions, including the INFORMS SOLA Best Student Paper Award, and a finalist of the POMS-HK Best Student Paper Award.

tackles complex challenges in <span style="font-weight: bold;"><font color="#750F09">modern service operations</font></span> (featured by innovative business models, technologies and initiatives) and <span style="font-weight: bold;"><font color="#750F09">socially responsible operations</font></span> (to improve social good and create public impact). Using tools from stochastic process, optimization, and data analytics, my work bridges theory and practice to develop efficient solutions and offer actionable insights.
<ul>
<li><b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font color="#750F09">Modern service operations</font></span></b>: This line of works study service environments featured by innovative business models, technologies and initiatives, including managing on-demand workforces [2], controlling drone delivery systems [3], and activating volunteers during medical emergencies [1,6].</li>
<li><b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font color="#750F09">Socially responsible operations</font></span></b>: This line of works enhance service systems to meet societal needs and create public impact, such as designing ambulance-drone networks for cardiac arrest response [1], optimizing community responder alert strategies [6], and deploying rescue teams for lift-trap incidents [7].</li>
</ul>
<p> 
I am also pursuing a theory-centered research agenda at <span style="font-weight: bold;"><font color="#750F09">data-driven queuing control</font></span>. By integrating statistical learning with queuing asymptotics, my focus is to develop data-driven and provably "optimal" policies for queuing systems with unknown primitives.</p>-->
